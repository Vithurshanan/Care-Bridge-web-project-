Project Title: Care Bridge - A Web Platform for Cancer Patient Support

Project Description:

The Care Bridge project is a web-based platform designed to support cancer patients by facilitating better communication between patients and healthcare professionals. This project serves as a tool for gathering crucial medical information directly from doctors, helping patients manage their treatment journeys with greater ease and transparency.

The platform is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack for the back end, ensuring a scalable and robust infrastructure for handling data and user interactions. On the front end, technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are employed to create an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

Key features include:

Secure channels for doctors to share medical updates, test results, and treatment plans.
A patient dashboard where users can track their progress and access personalized health information.
Interactive elements for better engagement between patients and healthcare providers.
This project was developed as part of a university initiative, aiming to combine technological innovation with compassionate healthcare solutions. Care Bridge strives to bridge the gap between patients and doctors, ensuring timely and effective communication during critical stages of cancer treatment.
